---

## What Doesn't Work Yet

### ‚ùå Not Yet Implemented
1. **Core Messaging**
   - No message sending/receiving (services ready, need ViewModels/Views)
   - No real-time sync UI (listeners implemented, need Views)
   - No optimistic UI display (logic ready, need Views)
   - No offline queue UI (backend ready, need Views)

2. **User Features**
   - No authentication UI (AuthService ready, need Views)
   - No conversation list (ConversationService ready, need Views)
   - No chat UI (MessageService ready, need Views)
   - No notifications (will use .apns files for simulator)

3. **ViewModels & Views**
   - No ViewModels yet (next: AuthViewModel)
   - No views implemented (except placeholder ContentView)
   - No navigation flow
   - No user interactions

4. **Integration**
   - Services not yet connected to UI
   - No network monitoring utility
   - No app lifecycle handling

---

## Known Issues

### üêõ Current Issues
1. **No ViewModels or Views**
   - Issue: Services exist but no UI layer
   - Impact: Can't interact with app yet
   - Priority: High
   - Fix: Implement PR #4 (Authentication) immediately

2. **No Testing Infrastructure**
   - Issue: No unit tests, UI tests, or integration tests
   - Impact: Can't verify features work
   - Priority: Medium
   - Fix: Add tests incrementally with each PR

3. **No Network Monitoring**
   - Issue: Services don't detect online/offline state
   - Impact: Can't trigger offline queue logic
   - Priority: Medium
   - Fix: Create NetworkMonitor utility in PR #7 or #15

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Technical Debt
1. **Using feature branch**
   - Currently: feature/firebase-service
   - Should merge to main and create new branch for PR #4
   - Risk: Branch getting too large
   - Fix: Merge PR #3, start fresh feature/authentication

2. **No CI/CD**
   - No automated testing or builds
   - Risk: Bugs slip through
   - Fix: Add GitHub Actions or Xcode Cloud (post-MVP)

3. **No input validation**
   - Services don't validate inputs
   - Risk: Runtime crashes or Firestore errors
   - Fix: Add validation in ViewModels before calling services

## Risk Assessment

### High Risks
1. **Timeline Pressure**
   - Risk: 24 hours is aggressive
   - Mitigation: Focus on critical path, cut optional features
   - Status: Monitoring closely

2. **Real-Time Sync Complexity**
   - Risk: Message merging and deduplication is tricky
   - Mitigation: Follow established patterns, thorough testing
   - Status: Design complete, implementation pending

3. **Offline Support Reliability**
   - Risk: Message queue could lose data
   - Mitigation: SwiftData persistence, sequential flush
   - Status: Design complete, implementation pending

### Medium Risks
1. **Firestore Costs**
   - Risk: Lots of real-time listeners = high read costs
   - Mitigation: Efficient queries, proper cleanup
   - Status: Acceptable for MVP testing

2. **Testing on Simulator Only**
   - Risk: Missing real-world issues
   - Mitigation: Thorough simulator testing, .apns files
   - Status: Acceptable for MVP

### Low Risks
1. **UI/UX Quality**
   - Risk: MVP UI might be basic
   - Mitigation: Function over form is OK for MVP
   - Status: Not a concern

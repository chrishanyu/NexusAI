## What Doesn't Work Yet

### ❌ Not Yet Implemented
1. **Group Chat** (PR #12)
   - No group creation UI
   - No group info/settings screen
   - No group participant management
   - Basic group infrastructure exists in models/services

2. **Push Notifications** (PR #13)
   - No notification handling
   - No FCM token management in UI
   - Will use .apns files for simulator testing

3. **Enhanced Features**
   - Typing indicators (placeholder exists, PR #9)
   - Read receipts (basic infrastructure, needs full PR #10)
   - Enhanced presence system (basic exists, PR #11)
   - Message editing/deletion (post-MVP)
   - Media messages (post-MVP)

4. **Polish & Quality**
   - Limited testing done (basic verification only)
   - No comprehensive error handling
   - Basic UI (functional but not polished)
   - No dark mode optimization
   - No animations beyond basics

---

## Known Issues

### 🐛 Current Issues
1. **Limited Testing Done**
   - Issue: Only basic verification testing completed
   - Impact: Unknown bugs may exist in edge cases
   - Priority: HIGH
   - Fix: Complete Task 10 (comprehensive testing)

2. **No Comprehensive Error Handling**
   - Issue: Error messages exist but coverage incomplete
   - Impact: Some errors may not show user-friendly messages
   - Priority: Medium
   - Fix: PR #16 (Error Handling)

3. **Basic UI Polish**
   - Issue: UI is functional but not fully polished
   - Impact: Animations, dark mode may have issues
   - Priority: Low
   - Fix: PR #17 (UI Polish)

### ⚠️ Technical Debt
1. **Multiple feature branches**
   - Core messaging (PRs #5-8) may be in multiple branches
   - Should merge to main and consolidate
   - Risk: Branch management complexity
   - Fix: Merge all core messaging PRs to main

2. **No CI/CD**
   - No automated testing or builds
   - Risk: Bugs slip through
   - Fix: Add GitHub Actions or Xcode Cloud (post-MVP)

3. **No input validation**
   - Services don't validate inputs
   - Risk: Runtime crashes or Firestore errors
   - Fix: Add validation in ViewModels before calling services

## Risk Assessment

### High Risks
1. **Timeline Pressure**
   - Risk: 24 hours is aggressive
   - Mitigation: Focus on critical path, cut optional features
   - Status: Monitoring closely

2. **Real-Time Sync Complexity**
   - Risk: Message merging and deduplication is tricky
   - Mitigation: Follow established patterns, thorough testing
   - Status: Design complete, implementation pending

3. **Offline Support Reliability**
   - Risk: Message queue could lose data
   - Mitigation: SwiftData persistence, sequential flush
   - Status: Design complete, implementation pending

### Medium Risks
1. **Firestore Costs**
   - Risk: Lots of real-time listeners = high read costs
   - Mitigation: Efficient queries, proper cleanup
   - Status: Acceptable for MVP testing

2. **Testing on Simulator Only**
   - Risk: Missing real-world issues
   - Mitigation: Thorough simulator testing, .apns files
   - Status: Acceptable for MVP

### Low Risks
1. **UI/UX Quality**
   - Risk: MVP UI might be basic
   - Mitigation: Function over form is OK for MVP
   - Status: Not a concern

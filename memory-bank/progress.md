## What Doesn't Work Yet

### ‚ùå Not Yet Implemented
1. **Core Messaging**
   - No message sending/receiving
   - No real-time sync
   - No optimistic UI
   - No offline queue

2. **User Features**
   - No authentication
   - No conversation list
   - No chat UI
   - No notifications

3. **Services Layer**
   - No Firebase integration
   - No local storage
   - No network monitoring
   - No presence tracking

4. **UI/UX**
   - No views implemented (except placeholder ContentView)
   - No ViewModels
   - No navigation flow
   - No user interactions

---

## Known Issues

### üêõ Current Issues
1. **Git Status Inconsistency**
   - Issue: Model files staged + unstaged simultaneously
   - Impact: Unclear what changes are ready to commit
   - Priority: Medium
   - Fix: Review diffs, commit clean versions

2. **No Service Layer**
   - Issue: Models exist but can't be used yet
   - Impact: Can't test or build features
   - Priority: High
   - Fix: Implement PR #3 immediately

3. **No Testing Infrastructure**
   - Issue: No unit tests, UI tests, or integration tests
   - Impact: Can't verify features work
   - Priority: Medium
   - Fix: Add tests incrementally with each PR

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Technical Debt
1. **Working on main branch**
   - Should use feature branches per PR
   - Risk: Harder to rollback changes
   - Fix: Start using `feature/*` branches

2. **No CI/CD**
   - No automated testing or builds
   - Risk: Bugs slip through
   - Fix: Add GitHub Actions or Xcode Cloud (post-MVP)

3. **Minimal error handling**
   - Models don't validate data
   - Risk: Runtime crashes
   - Fix: Add validation in services/ViewModels

## Risk Assessment

### High Risks
1. **Timeline Pressure**
   - Risk: 24 hours is aggressive
   - Mitigation: Focus on critical path, cut optional features
   - Status: Monitoring closely

2. **Real-Time Sync Complexity**
   - Risk: Message merging and deduplication is tricky
   - Mitigation: Follow established patterns, thorough testing
   - Status: Design complete, implementation pending

3. **Offline Support Reliability**
   - Risk: Message queue could lose data
   - Mitigation: SwiftData persistence, sequential flush
   - Status: Design complete, implementation pending

### Medium Risks
1. **Firestore Costs**
   - Risk: Lots of real-time listeners = high read costs
   - Mitigation: Efficient queries, proper cleanup
   - Status: Acceptable for MVP testing

2. **Testing on Simulator Only**
   - Risk: Missing real-world issues
   - Mitigation: Thorough simulator testing, .apns files
   - Status: Acceptable for MVP

### Low Risks
1. **UI/UX Quality**
   - Risk: MVP UI might be basic
   - Mitigation: Function over form is OK for MVP
   - Status: Not a concern

## What Doesn't Work Yet

### ❌ Not Yet Implemented
1. **Core Messaging**
   - No message sending/receiving (services ready, need ChatViewModel/ChatView)
   - No real-time sync UI (listeners implemented, need Views)
   - No optimistic UI display (logic ready, need Views)
   - No offline queue UI (backend ready, need Views)

2. **User Features**
   - No conversation list (ConversationService ready, need ConversationListViewModel/Views)
   - No chat UI (MessageService ready, need ChatViewModel/Views)
   - No notifications (will use .apns files for simulator)
   - No group creation UI

3. **ViewModels & Views**
   - No ConversationListViewModel yet (next: PR #5)
   - No ChatViewModel (next: PR #6)
   - No conversation list views
   - No chat screen views

4. **Integration**
   - ConversationService not yet connected to UI
   - MessageService not yet connected to UI
   - No network monitoring utility
   - No app lifecycle presence handling

## Known Issues

### 🐛 Current Issues
1. **No Conversation List UI**
   - Issue: Authentication works but no way to start conversations
   - Impact: Can't access messaging features yet
   - Priority: High
   - Fix: Implement PR #5 (Conversation List) immediately

2. **Limited Testing Infrastructure**
   - Issue: No unit tests, UI tests, or integration tests
   - Impact: Can't verify features work
   - Priority: Medium
   - Fix: Add tests incrementally with each PR

3. **No Network Monitoring**
   - Issue: Services don't detect online/offline state
   - Impact: Can't trigger offline queue logic
   - Priority: Medium
   - Fix: Create NetworkMonitor utility in PR #7 or #15

### ⚠️ Technical Debt
1. **Using feature branch**
   - Currently: feature/auth
   - Should merge to main and create new branch for PR #5
   - Risk: Branch getting stale
   - Fix: Merge PR #4, start fresh feature/conversation-list

2. **No CI/CD**
   - No automated testing or builds
   - Risk: Bugs slip through
   - Fix: Add GitHub Actions or Xcode Cloud (post-MVP)

3. **No input validation**
   - Services don't validate inputs
   - Risk: Runtime crashes or Firestore errors
   - Fix: Add validation in ViewModels before calling services

## Risk Assessment

### High Risks
1. **Timeline Pressure**
   - Risk: 24 hours is aggressive
   - Mitigation: Focus on critical path, cut optional features
   - Status: Monitoring closely

2. **Real-Time Sync Complexity**
   - Risk: Message merging and deduplication is tricky
   - Mitigation: Follow established patterns, thorough testing
   - Status: Design complete, implementation pending

3. **Offline Support Reliability**
   - Risk: Message queue could lose data
   - Mitigation: SwiftData persistence, sequential flush
   - Status: Design complete, implementation pending

### Medium Risks
1. **Firestore Costs**
   - Risk: Lots of real-time listeners = high read costs
   - Mitigation: Efficient queries, proper cleanup
   - Status: Acceptable for MVP testing

2. **Testing on Simulator Only**
   - Risk: Missing real-world issues
   - Mitigation: Thorough simulator testing, .apns files
   - Status: Acceptable for MVP

### Low Risks
1. **UI/UX Quality**
   - Risk: MVP UI might be basic
   - Mitigation: Function over form is OK for MVP
   - Status: Not a concern

### ✅ Robust Presence System (Firebase RTDB + Firestore Hybrid)
**Status:** COMPLETE ✅  
**Completion Date:** October 24, 2025  
**Total Scope:** 8 tasks (6 implementation + 2 cleanup), 50 sub-tasks

**Summary:**
Production-ready presence tracking using Firebase Realtime Database for reliable online/offline status. Implements server-side disconnect detection, heartbeat mechanism, offline queue, and iOS background task integration.

**Implementation Details:**

**Task 1.0 - Firebase RTDB SDK and Setup** ✅
- Added FirebaseDatabase package dependency to Xcode project
- Updated `FirebaseService` to include RTDB reference initialization
- Tested Firebase RTDB connection (read/write verified in Firebase console)

**Task 2.0 - RealtimePresenceService Core Implementation** ✅  
- Created `RealtimePresenceService.swift` with singleton pattern
- Implemented `initializePresence(for userId:)` with RTDB reference setup
- Implemented `setUserOnline()` and `setUserOffline()` with delay support
- Implemented `setupConnectionStateMonitoring()` with `.info/connected` listener
- Implemented `onDisconnect()` callback for server-side offline detection
- Implemented `startHeartbeat()` with 30-second Timer
- Implemented `listenToPresence()` and `listenToMultiplePresence()` for real-time updates
- Implemented stale presence detection (>60s heartbeat = offline)
- Added `cleanup()` method for proper resource management
- Created `RealtimePresenceError` enum for error handling

**Task 3.0 - Offline Queue and Network Monitoring** ✅
- Created `PresenceQueue` Actor for thread-safe offline updates
- Implemented `QueuedPresenceUpdate` struct with userId, isOnline, timestamp
- Implemented `enqueue()` with deduplication (one update per user)
- Implemented `flushQueue()` with retry on failure and re-queueing
- Integrated `NetworkMonitor.shared.$isConnected` publisher
- Auto-flush queue when network reconnects

**Task 4.0 - App Lifecycle and ViewModel Integration** ✅
- Updated `NexusAIApp.handleScenePhaseChange()` to use `RealtimePresenceService.shared`
- Added `initializePresence()` call on `.active` state
- Added iOS background task integration for reliable offline updates
- Proper error handling with do-catch blocks
- Updated `ConversationListViewModel` to use RTDB listeners
- Verified `GroupInfoViewModel` compatibility (reads from User.isOnline)

**Task 5.0 - Firestore Sync for Persistence** ✅
- Implemented `updateFirestorePresence()` private method
- Syncs RTDB presence to Firestore User.isOnline field
- Handles sync failures gracefully (logs but doesn't block)
- Keeps User model in sync for Firestore queries

**Task 8.0 - Migration and Cleanup** ✅  
- Verified no remaining references to old `PresenceService`
- Deleted `Services/PresenceService.swift` (legacy service)
- Fixed critical bugs:
  - Auth state listener now initializes presence for already-logged-in users
  - Background offline updates use delay=0 with iOS background tasks
  - Added `FirebaseDatabase` import to `ConversationListViewModel`

**Files Created:**
- `Services/RealtimePresenceService.swift` - Main presence service (300+ lines)
  - Singleton with RTDB integration
  - `PresenceQueue` Actor for offline updates
  - Connection monitoring, heartbeat, onDisconnect callbacks

**Files Modified:**
- `Services/FirebaseService.swift` - Added RTDB reference
- `NexusAIApp.swift` - Lifecycle integration + iOS background tasks
- `ViewModels/AuthViewModel.swift` - Presence initialization on auth (CRITICAL FIX)
- `ViewModels/ConversationListViewModel.swift` - RTDB listeners, Firebase Database import
- `README.md` - Added Robust Presence System section
- `memory-bank/systemPatterns.md` - Updated Pattern #4 with new architecture

**Files Deleted:**
- `Services/PresenceService.swift` - Legacy Firestore-based presence service

**Critical Bugs Fixed:**
1. **Auth state listener bug** - Presence wasn't initialized for already-logged-in users on app restart
2. **Background offline bug** - 5-second delay caused iOS suspension before completion. Fixed with immediate update + background task
3. **Memory leak** - Connection state listener wasn't being removed. Added proper cleanup

**What Now Works:**
- ✅ Users show online immediately when app opens
- ✅ Users show offline immediately when app backgrounds
- ✅ Users show offline when app force-quit or crashes (via onDisconnect)
- ✅ Users show offline when network is lost for >60s (stale detection)
- ✅ Presence updates queue when offline and auto-flush on reconnect
- ✅ Green online indicators display in conversation list
- ✅ No Firestore listener limits (RTDB supports unlimited listeners)
- ✅ Hybrid sync keeps Firestore User.isOnline in sync

**Key Technical Features:**
- **Server-Side Disconnect:** Firebase RTDB `onDisconnect()` callback
- **Heartbeat Mechanism:** 30-second interval, 60-second stale threshold
- **Offline Queue:** Swift Actor for thread-safe queueing with deduplication
- **iOS Background Task:** Ensures offline updates complete before suspension
- **Hybrid Sync:** RTDB for real-time + Firestore for persistence

**Performance Characteristics:**
- Heartbeat: 30s interval (minimal bandwidth)
- Stale threshold: 60s (users offline if no heartbeat)
- Background delay: 0s (immediate offline when backgrounding)
- Queue deduplication: Latest update per user
- No listener limits: Unlike Firestore's 10-user "in" query limit

**Documentation:**
- `tasks/prd-robust-presence-system.md` - Complete PRD
- `tasks/tasks-prd-robust-presence-system.md` - All 50 tasks (100% complete)
- `README.md` - Architecture section added
- `memory-bank/systemPatterns.md` - Pattern #4 updated with detailed implementation

### ✅ User Profile & Bottom Navigation
**Status:** COMPLETE ✅  
**Completion Date:** October 25, 2025  
**Total Scope:** 6 tasks, 60 sub-tasks

**Summary:**
Implemented tab-based bottom navigation with Chat and Profile tabs, including user profile screen with repository integration and smooth UX transitions.

**Implementation Details:**

**Task 1.0-3.0 - Core UI Components** ✅
- Created `MainTabView` with iOS-native tab bar (Chat + Profile tabs)
- Created `ProfileView` with user information display (profile picture, name, email)
- Created `ProfileViewModel` with repository integration for data fetching
- Implemented logout functionality with proper auth cleanup
- Added tab state persistence with `@AppStorage`

**Task 4.0 - Tab Navigation Behavior** ✅
- Tab bar stays visible for smooth navigation transitions
- Tab bar hides automatically when keyboard appears (typing messages)
- Tapping Chat tab while in ChatView navigates back to conversation list
- Tapping Chat/Profile tab while at root scrolls to top
- Tab selection persists across app launches

**Task 5.0 - Scroll-to-Top on Active Tab Tap** ✅
- Implemented scroll-to-top using `ScrollViewReader` and `NotificationCenter`
- Chat tab: scrolls conversation list or pops navigation if in child view
- Profile tab: scrolls profile content to top
- Smooth animated scrolling with spring animation

**Task 6.0 - Integration & Polish** ✅
- Fixed `@State` vs `@ObservedObject` issue causing "Unknown User" bug
- Split ProfileView into ProfileView + ProfileContentView for proper observation
- Added comprehensive logging for debugging data flow
- Tested tab switching, keyboard hiding, navigation popping
- All edge cases handled (keyboard + tab bar, navigation back, etc.)

**Files Created:**
- `Views/Main/MainTabView.swift` - Tab bar container with keyboard handling
- `Views/Profile/ProfileView.swift` - Profile screen with lazy ViewModel initialization  
- `Views/Profile/ProfileContentView.swift` - Content view with @ObservedObject
- `ViewModels/ProfileViewModel.swift` - Profile state management with UserRepository integration

**Files Modified:**
- `ContentView.swift` - Shows MainTabView instead of ConversationListView
- `Views/Chat/ChatView.swift` - No tab bar visibility changes (stays visible)
- `Views/ConversationList/ConversationListView.swift` - Added navigation pop on tab tap, scroll-to-top
- `Utilities/Constants.swift` - Added notification names for scroll-to-top and keyboard

**Critical Bugs Fixed:**
1. **"Unknown User" bug** - `@State` doesn't observe `@Published` properties. Fixed by splitting into ProfileView + ProfileContentView with `@ObservedObject`
2. **Task not executing** - ProfileViewModel's `Task` in `init()` wasn't running. Added explicit `@MainActor` context
3. **Tab bar delay** - Initial attempts to hide tab bar in ChatView caused clunky UX. Final decision: keep visible for smooth transitions, hide on keyboard

**What Now Works:**
- ✅ Bottom tab navigation (Chat and Profile tabs)
- ✅ Profile screen shows correct user data (name, email, photo)
- ✅ Logout functionality with proper cleanup
- ✅ Tab state persists across app launches
- ✅ Tab bar hides when keyboard appears (typing messages)
- ✅ Tab bar reappears when keyboard dismisses
- ✅ Tapping tab while in child view navigates back
- ✅ Tapping tab at root scrolls to top
- ✅ Smooth navigation transitions

**Key Technical Achievements:**
- **Lazy ViewModel initialization** - ProfileViewModel created after AuthViewModel available from environment
- **Proper SwiftUI observation** - Used @ObservedObject in separate ContentView for reactivity
- **Keyboard-aware UI** - Tab bar responds to keyboard notifications dynamically
- **Navigation coordination** - NotificationCenter for tab tap → scroll/pop actions
- **Repository pattern** - ProfileViewModel uses UserRepository for data access

**UX Decisions:**
- **Tab bar stays visible** - Chose smooth transitions over maximizing screen space
- **Keyboard hides tab bar** - Automatic behavior gives more space for messaging
- **No draft message saving** - Deemed too complex for this phase
- **Accept standard iOS delay** - Slight tab bar animation delay is normal SwiftUI behavior

**Documentation:**

**Task 5.0 - UI Components** ✅
- Created `ActionItemRow` with checkbox, badges, priority indicator
- Created `ConversationActionItemsSheet` full-screen modal
- Sections: Incomplete (always visible), Completed (collapsible)
- Empty state: "No action items yet. Tap Extract to analyze..."
- Loading overlay: ProgressView with purple theme matching AI Assistant
- Error alerts with retry button
- Success toast: "✅ Saved X action items" (auto-dismiss)

**Task 6.0 - ViewModel** ✅
- Created `ActionItemViewModel` as @MainActor ObservableObject
- @Published properties: items, isLoading, errorMessage, showSuccessToast
- Methods: loadItems, extractItems, toggleComplete, deleteItem, updateItem
- Computed properties: incompleteItems, completedItems, incompleteCount
- Observation pattern for real-time data updates

**Task 7.0 - ChatView Integration** ✅
- Added checklist toolbar button (no badge per user preference)
- Sheet presentation with ConversationActionItemsSheet
- ViewModel lifecycle fix (initialized once in init, not in sheet closure)
- Passes conversation messages and metadata to extraction
- Real-time updates when items change

**Files Created (8 new files):**
- `Models/ActionItem.swift` - Core model with helpers
- `Models/Priority.swift` - Priority enum
- `Data/Models/LocalActionItem.swift` - SwiftData persistence
- `Data/Repositories/Protocols/ActionItemRepositoryProtocol.swift` - Protocol
- `Data/Repositories/ActionItemRepository.swift` - Implementation
- `ViewModels/ActionItemViewModel.swift` - Business logic
- `Views/ActionItems/ConversationActionItemsSheet.swift` - Main UI
- `Views/ActionItems/ActionItemRow.swift` - Row component

**Files Modified:**
- `Services/AIService.swift` - Added extraction and JSON parsing
- `Views/Chat/ChatView.swift` - Toolbar button and sheet integration
- `Data/Repositories/RepositoryFactory.swift` - Added ActionItemRepository
- `Data/LocalDatabase.swift` - Added LocalActionItem to schema

**Critical Bugs Fixed:**
1. **SwiftData SortDescriptor limitations** - Bool and optional Date properties don't work with SortDescriptor; implemented manual in-memory sorting
2. **UI flickering** - Sheet re-evaluation was creating new ViewModels; fixed by initializing ViewModel once in ChatView init
3. **Badge removed** - User preference for cleaner UI
4. **Debug logs removed** - Production-ready code

**What Now Works:**
- ✅ GPT-4 extraction from conversation messages
- ✅ Structured JSON parsing with error handling
- ✅ SwiftData persistence with repository pattern
- ✅ Real-time observation updates
- ✅ Mark complete/incomplete with checkbox
- ✅ Visual badges (assignee, deadline, priority)
- ✅ Deadline coloring (red=overdue, blue=upcoming)
- ✅ Empty states and loading overlays
- ✅ Error handling with retry
- ✅ Haptic feedback
- ✅ Smooth animations (no flickering!)
- ✅ Persistence across app restarts

**Key Technical Achievements:**
- **GPT-4 Integration** - Structured output with JSON schema in prompt
- **Repository Pattern** - Clean separation with protocols for testability
- **Manual Sorting** - Workaround for SwiftData limitations (incomplete first, then by deadline)
- **Observation Pattern** - Real-time UI updates via AsyncStream
- **Lifecycle Management** - ViewModel initialized once, preventing UI flicker
- **Error Resilience** - Handles network errors, JSON parsing errors, markdown stripping

**Performance Characteristics:**
- Extraction: ~2-5 seconds (GPT-4 API call + parsing)
- UI Updates: Instant (observation pattern)
- Persistence: <100ms (SwiftData)
- Sorting: O(n log n) in-memory

**Documentation:**
- `tasks/prd-action-items-extraction.md` - Complete PRD
- `tasks/tasks-prd-action-items-extraction.md` - Phase 1 tasks (100% complete)

# Product Context

## Why This Project Exists

Remote teams struggle with message overload and context switching. Current messaging tools (Slack, Teams) lack intelligent features to help teams:
- Quickly catch up on long threads
- Track decisions and action items
- Find relevant discussions
- Prioritize urgent messages

Nexus solves this by combining **reliable messaging infrastructure** with **AI-powered team intelligence**.

## The Problem We're Solving

### For Remote Teams:
1. **Context Loss:** Hard to catch up after time off or timezone differences
2. **Decision Tracking:** Decisions buried in long threads
3. **Action Items:** Tasks mentioned in chat get forgotten
4. **Message Overload:** Can't distinguish urgent from routine messages
5. **Knowledge Silos:** Past discussions hard to surface when needed

### For MVP Phase:
First, we need **rock-solid messaging** that teams can trust. Without reliable delivery, offline support, and proper sync, no AI feature matters.

## How It Works

### MVP User Experience

**For Individual Users:**
1. Sign up with email/password
2. See list of conversations (direct and group)
3. Send messages that appear instantly (optimistic UI)
4. Messages sync in real-time to all participants
5. See who's online, who's typing, who's read messages
6. Messages work offline and sync when reconnected

**For Groups:**
1. Create groups with multiple team members
2. Send group messages visible to all
3. See individual read receipts ("Read by 3/5")
4. Track who's participating actively

### Post-MVP User Experience (AI Features)

**Thread Summarization:**
- Tap "Summarize" on long thread
- AI provides TL;DR with key points
- Saves time catching up

**Action Item Extraction:**
- AI automatically detects tasks mentioned
- Creates actionable list from conversations
- Links back to original messages

**Smart Search:**
- Natural language queries: "What did we decide about Q4 goals?"
- AI finds relevant discussions across all chats
- Understands context, not just keywords

**Priority Detection:**
- AI flags urgent messages that need immediate attention
- Reduces notification fatigue
- Helps focus on what matters

**Decision Tracking:**
- AI identifies when decisions are made
- Creates searchable decision log
- Links to full context

## User Journey

### First-Time User
1. **Onboarding:** Sign up → Set display name → Grant notification permission
2. **First Message:** Start conversation → Send message → See instant delivery
3. **Offline Test:** Turn on airplane mode → Send message → See "sending" → Reconnect → Message delivers
4. **Discovery:** Experience real-time sync, typing indicators, read receipts

### Daily Active User
1. **Morning Check:** Open app → See overnight messages → Catch up quickly
2. **Active Chatting:** Send messages → Real-time responses → Group discussions
3. **Context Switching:** Background app → Receive notification → Tap → Jump to conversation
4. **End of Day:** Messages persist, ready for tomorrow

### Post-MVP AI User
1. **Long Thread:** Missed 50 messages → Tap "Summarize" → Get caught up in seconds
2. **Action Tracking:** Discussed project tasks → Check "Action Items" → See extracted todos
3. **Finding Info:** Need old decision → Ask "What did we decide about X?" → Get answer immediately

## Success Metrics

### MVP Phase (Technical Reliability)
- **Message Delivery:** 100% delivery rate, no lost messages
- **Sync Time:** <1s message delivery under good network
- **Offline Recovery:** 100% message recovery after reconnection
- **Crash Rate:** <1% crash rate during testing
- **Real-time Feel:** Optimistic UI makes messages appear <100ms

### Post-MVP Phase (User Value)
- **Time Saved:** Users catch up 5x faster with summaries

## Design Philosophy

### MVP Focus: Infrastructure First
- Function over form
- Reliability over features
- Simple UI that works perfectly
- WhatsApp-inspired UX (familiar, proven)

### AI Integration: Value Over Novelty
- AI features must save time, not add complexity
- Every AI feature solves real user pain point
- AI is invisible until needed (contextual triggers)
- Always show AI reasoning (no black box)
